Geofencing combines awareness of the user's current location with awareness of
nearby features, defined as the user's proximity to locations that may be of
interest. To mark a location of interest, you specify its latitude and longitude.
To adjust the proximity for the location, you add a radius. The latitude,
longitude, and radius define a geofence. You can have multiple active
geofences at one time.

To use geofencing, start by defining the geofences you want to monitor.
Although you usually store geofence data in a local database or download
it from the network, you need to send a geofence to Location Services as
an instance of [Geofence][2], which you create with `Geofence.Builder`. Each
Geofence object contains the following information:

1. Latitude, longitude, and radius
2. Expiration time
3. Transition type
4. Geofence ID

Read more about geofences in [Creating and Monitoring Geofences][1].
