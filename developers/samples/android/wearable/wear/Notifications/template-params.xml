        <intro>
This sample app enables the user to choose a notification type (the selection is done on the phone),
which it then displays on the phone and wearable. The notification is built using
[NotificationCompat.Builder][1] and [NotificationCompat.WearableExtender][2].

See [Creating a Notification][3] for all the details on how to create a notification with wearable features.

On the wearable side, the sample also shows how to create a custom layout using [WearableListView][4].
