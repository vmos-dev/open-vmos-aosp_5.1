<![CDATA[
This sample demonstrates how to make a handheld and an Android Wear device communicate
using the [DataApi][2].
It does this by sending a picture between connected devices.

An Activity is being used for both the connected devices which implement their parts of
the required interfaces.

It showcases how to use an [WearableListenerService][1] to consume DataEvents
as well as implementations for various required listeners when using the [DataApi][2],
[MessageApi][3] and [NodeApi][4].
