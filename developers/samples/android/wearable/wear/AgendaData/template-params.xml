Using the Wearable [DataApi][1] allows to transmit data such as event time,
description, and background image.

The sent [DataItems][2] can be deleted individually via an action on the event notifications,
or all at once via a button on the companion.

When deleted using the notification action, a ConfirmationActivity is used to indicate
success or failure. The sample shows implementations for both the success as well failure case.
