This sample shows a simple service that sends notifications using
NotificationCompat. In addition to sending a notification, it also extends
the notification with a CarExtender to make it compatible with Android Auto.
Each unread conversation from a user is sent as a distinct notification.

#### Checklist while building a messaging app that supports Android Auto:
1. Ensure that Message notifications are extended using
NotificationCompat.Builder.extend(new CarExtender()...)
2. Declare a meta-data tag to your AndroidManifest.xml to specify that your app
is automotive enabled.

example: AndroidManifest.xml

```
       <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.car.application"
                   android:resource="@xml/automotive_app_desc"/>
```

Include the following to indicate that the application wants to show notifications on
the Android Auto overview screen.

example: res/xml/automotive\_app\_desc.xml
```
        <automotiveApp>
            <uses name="notification"/>
        </automotiveApp>
```

#### Flow
MessagingFragment is shown to the user. Depending on the button clicked, the MessagingService is
sent a message. MessagingService in turn creates notifications which can be viewed either on the
device or in the messaging-simulator.

When a message is read, the associated PendingIntent is triggered and MessageReadReceiver is called
with the appropriate conversationId. Similarly, when a reply is received, the MessageReplyReceiver
is called with the appropriate conversationId. MessageLogger logs each event and shows them in a
TextView in MessagingFragment for correlation.
