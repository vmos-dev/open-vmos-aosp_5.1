This sample demonstrates the borderless button styling from the Holo visual language.
Styling is applied in the XML resource layout definitions, referecing the styling attributes
from the Holo theme.

Introduction
------------

This sample shows how to style widgets in an Activity using [borderless elements][1].
This includes a ListView with custom rows and buttons, using dividing lines to create
visual separatation.

Style definitions are provided by the Holo theme, which includes references to the 
'?android:buttonBarButtonStyle' for buttons and references to the appropriate divider 
attribute and style 'android:dividerVertical'.

Styles are directly applied to widgets in their XML layout definitions.
