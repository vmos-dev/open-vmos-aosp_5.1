          <description>
          The mode control selects how the image data is converted from the
          sensor's native color into linear sRGB color.
          </description>
          <details>
          When auto-white balance (AWB) is enabled with android.control.awbMode, this
          control is overridden by the AWB routine. When AWB is disabled, the
          application controls how the color mapping is performed.

          We define the expected processing pipeline below. For consistency
          across devices, this is always the case with TRANSFORM_MATRIX.

          When either FULL or HIGH_QUALITY is used, the camera device may
          do additional processing but android.colorCorrection.gains and
          android.colorCorrection.transform will still be provided by the
          camera device (in the results) and be roughly correct.

          Switching to TRANSFORM_MATRIX and using the data provided from
          FAST or HIGH_QUALITY will yield a picture with the same white point
          as what was produced by the camera device in the earlier frame.

          The expected processing pipeline is as follows:

          ![White balance processing pipeline](android.colorCorrection.mode/processing_pipeline.png)

          The white balance is encoded by two values, a 4-channel white-balance
          gain vector (applied in the Bayer domain), and a 3x3 color transform
          matrix (applied after demosaic).

          The 4-channel white-balance gains are defined as:

              android.colorCorrection.gains = [ R G_even G_odd B ]

          where `G_even` is the gain for green pixels on even rows of the
          output, and `G_odd` is the gain for green pixels on the odd rows.
          These may be identical for a given camera device implementation; if
          the camera device does not support a separate gain for even/odd green
          channels, it will use the `G_even` value, and write `G_odd` equal to
          `G_even` in the output result metadata.

          The matrices for color transforms are defined as a 9-entry vector:

              android.colorCorrection.transform = [ I0 I1 I2 I3 I4 I5 I6 I7 I8 ]

          which define a transform from input sensor colors, `P_in = [ r g b ]`,
          to output linear sRGB, `P_out = [ r' g' b' ]`,

          with colors as follows:

              r' = I0r + I1g + I2b
              g' = I3r + I4g + I5b
              b' = I6r + I7g + I8b

          Both the input and output value ranges must match. Overflow/underflow
          values are clipped to fit within the range.

          In the latter case, the camera device may round the matrix to account
          for precision issues; the final rounded matrix should be reported back
          in this matrix result metadata. The transform should keep the magnitude
          of the output color values within `[0, 1.0]` (assuming input color
          values is within the normalized range `[0, 1.0]`), or clipping may occur.

          for green pixels on even rows of the output, and `G_odd`
          is the gain for green pixels on the odd rows.

          If a HAL does not support a separate gain for even/odd green
          channels, it must use the `G_even` value, and write
          `G_odd` equal to `G_even` in the output result metadata.

            Mode of operation for the chromatic aberration correction algorithm.

          <range>android.colorCorrection.availableAberrationModes</range>
          <details>
            Chromatic (color) aberration is caused by the fact that different wavelengths of light
            can not focus on the same point after exiting from the lens. This metadata defines
            the high level control of chromatic aberration correction algorithm, which aims to
            minimize the chromatic artifacts that may occur along the object boundaries in an
            image.

            FAST/HIGH_QUALITY both mean that camera device determined aberration
            correction will be applied. HIGH_QUALITY mode indicates that the camera device will
            use the highest-quality aberration correction algorithms, even if it slows down
            capture rate. FAST means the camera device will not slow down capture rate when
            applying aberration correction.

            LEGACY devices will always be in FAST mode.

            The desired setting for the camera device's auto-exposure

          <details>
            Some kinds of lighting fixtures, such as some fluorescent
            lights, flicker at the rate of the power supply frequency
            (60Hz or 50Hz, depending on country). While this is
            typically not noticeable to a person, it can be visible to
            a camera device. If a camera sets its exposure time to the
            wrong value, the flicker may become visible in the
            viewfinder as flicker or in a final captured image, as a
            set of variable-brightness bands across the image.

            Therefore, the auto-exposure routines of camera devices
            include antibanding routines that ensure that the chosen
            exposure value will not cause such banding. The choice of
            exposure time depends on the rate of flicker, which the
            camera device can detect automatically, or the expected
            rate can be selected by the application using this
            control.

            A given camera device may not support all of the possible
            options for the antibanding mode. The
            android.control.aeAvailableAntibandingModes key contains
            the available modes for a given camera device.

            AUTO mode is the default if it is available on given
            camera device. When AUTO mode is not available, the
            default will be either 50HZ or 60HZ, and both 50HZ
            and 60HZ will be available.

            If manual exposure control is enabled (by setting
            android.control.aeMode or android.control.mode to OFF),
            then this setting has no effect, and the application must
            ensure it selects exposure times that do not cause banding
            issues. The android.statistics.sceneFlicker key can assist
            the application in this.

            For all capture request templates, this field must be set

            60HZ must be available.

            If manual exposure control is enabled (by setting
            android.control.aeMode or android.control.mode to OFF),
            then the exposure values provided by the application must not be
            adjusted for antibanding.

          The adjustment is measured as a count of steps, with the
          step size defined by android.control.aeCompensationStep and the
          allowed range by android.control.aeCompensationRange.

          For example, if the exposure value (EV) step is 0.333, '6'
          will mean an exposure compensation of +2 EV; -3 will mean an
          exposure compensation of -1 EV. One EV represents a doubling
          of image brightness. Note that this control will only be
          effective if android.control.aeMode `!=` OFF. This control
          will take effect even when android.control.aeLock `== true`.

          may take several frames to reach the newly requested exposure target.
          During that time, android.control.aeState field will be in the SEARCHING
          state. Once the new exposure target is reached, android.control.aeState will
          change from SEARCHING to either CONVERGED, LOCKED (if AE lock is enabled), or
          FLASH_REQUIRED (if the scene is too dark for still capture).

          <description>Whether auto-exposure (AE) is currently locked to its latest
          calculated values.</description>
          <details>
          When set to `true` (ON), the AE algorithm is locked to its latest parameters,
          and will not change exposure settings until the lock is set to `false` (OFF).

          Note that even when AE is locked, the flash may be fired if
          the android.control.aeMode is ON_AUTO_FLASH /
          ON_ALWAYS_FLASH / ON_AUTO_FLASH_REDEYE.

          When android.control.aeExposureCompensation is changed, even if the AE lock
          is ON, the camera device will still adjust its exposure value.

          If AE precapture is triggered (see android.control.aePrecaptureTrigger)
          when AE is already locked, the camera device will not change the exposure time
          (android.sensor.exposureTime) and sensitivity (android.sensor.sensitivity)
          parameters. The flash may be fired if the android.control.aeMode
          is ON_AUTO_FLASH/ON_AUTO_FLASH_REDEYE and the scene is too dark. If the
          android.control.aeMode is ON_ALWAYS_FLASH, the scene may become overexposed.

          Since the camera device has a pipeline of in-flight requests, the settings that
          get locked do not necessarily correspond to the settings that were present in the
          latest capture result received from the camera device, since additional captures
          and AE updates may have occurred even before the result was sent out. If an
          application is switching between automatic and manual control and wishes to eliminate
          any flicker during the switch, the following procedure is recommended:

            1. Starting in auto-AE mode:
            2. Lock AE
            3. Wait for the first result to be output that has the AE locked
            4. Copy exposure settings from that result into a request, set the request to manual AE
            5. Submit the capture request, proceed to run manual AE as desired.

          See android.control.aeState for AE lock related state transition details.

            This control is only effective if android.control.mode is

            When set to any of the ON modes, the camera device's

            application's selected exposure time, sensor sensitivity,

              Not available if android.control.maxRegionsAe is 0.
              Otherwise will always be present.

              The maximum number of regions supported by the device is determined by the value
              of android.control.maxRegionsAe.

              The coordinate system is based on the active pixel array,
              with (0,0) being the top-left pixel in the active pixel array, and
              (android.sensor.info.activeArraySize.width - 1,
              android.sensor.info.activeArraySize.height - 1) being the
              bottom-right pixel in the active pixel array.

              The weight must be within `[0, 1000]`, and represents a weight
              for every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area
              with the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in
              the metering result. Metering areas can partially overlap and the
              camera device will add the weights in the overlap region.

              The weights are relative to weights of other exposure metering regions, so if only one
              region is used, all non-zero weights will have the same effect. A region with 0
              weight is ignored.

              If all regions have 0 weight, then no specific metering area needs to be used by the
              camera device.

              If the metering region is outside the used android.scaler.cropRegion returned in
              capture result metadata, the camera device will ignore the sections outside the crop
              region and output only the intersection rectangle as the metering region in the result
              metadata.  If the region is entirely outside the crop region, it will be ignored and
              not reported in the result metadata.

          <details>This entry is normally set to IDLE, or is not
          included at all in the request settings. When included and
          set to START, the camera device will trigger the auto-exposure (AE)
          precapture metering sequence.

          The precapture sequence should be triggered before starting a
          high-quality still capture for final metering decisions to
          be made, and for firing pre-capture flash pulses to estimate
          scene brightness and required final capture flash power, when
          the flash is enabled.

          Normally, this entry should be set to START for only a
          single request, and the application should wait until the
          sequence completes before starting a new one.

          When a precapture metering sequence is finished, the camera device
          may lock the auto-exposure routine internally to be able to accurately expose the
          subsequent still capture image (`android.control.captureIntent == STILL_CAPTURE`).
          For this case, the AE may not resume normal scan if no subsequent still capture is
          submitted. To ensure that the AE routine restarts normal scan, the application should
          submit a request with `android.control.aeLock == true`, followed by a request
          with `android.control.aeLock == false`, if the application decides not to submit a
          still capture request after the precapture sequence completes.

          The exact effect of auto-exposure (AE) precapture trigger
          depends on the current AE mode and state; see
          android.control.aeState for AE precapture state transition
          details.

          On LEGACY-level devices, the precapture trigger is not supported;
          capturing a high-resolution JPEG image will automatically trigger a
          precapture sequence before the high-resolution capture, including
          potentially firing a pre-capture flash.

            The focusing behavior should be suitable for still image

          dependent. It is recommended to lock AF by using android.control.afTrigger before

          When afMode is AUTO or MACRO, the lens must not move until an AF trigger is sent in a

          up with either FOCUSED_LOCKED or NOT_FOCUSED_LOCKED state (see
          android.control.afState for detailed state transitions), which indicates that the lens is
          locked and will not move. If camera movement (e.g. tilting camera) causes the lens to move
          after the lens is locked, the HAL must compensate this movement appropriately such that
          the same focal plane remains in focus.

          When afMode is one of the continuous auto focus modes, the HAL is free to start a AF
          scan whenever it's not locked. When the lens is locked after an AF trigger
          (see android.control.afState for detailed state transitions), the HAL should maintain the
          same lock behavior as above.

          When afMode is OFF, the application controls focus manually. The accuracy of the
          focus distance control depends on the android.lens.info.focusDistanceCalibration.
          However, the lens must not move regardless of the camera movement for any focus distance
          manual control.

          To put this in concrete terms, if the camera has lens elements which may move based on
          camera orientation or motion (e.g. due to gravity), then the HAL must drive the lens to
          remain in a fixed position invariant to the camera's orientation or motion, for example,
          by using accelerometer measurements in the lens control logic. This is a typical issue
          that will arise on camera modules with open-loop VCMs.

              Otherwise will always be present.

              The maximum number of focus areas supported by the device is determined by the value
              of android.control.maxRegionsAf.

              The coordinate system is based on the active pixel array,
              with (0,0) being the top-left pixel in the active pixel array, and
              (android.sensor.info.activeArraySize.width - 1,
              android.sensor.info.activeArraySize.height - 1) being the
              bottom-right pixel in the active pixel array.

              The weight must be within `[0, 1000]`, and represents a weight
              for every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area
              with the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in
              the metering result. Metering areas can partially overlap and the
              camera device will add the weights in the overlap region.

              The weights are relative to weights of other metering regions, so if only one region
              is used, all non-zero weights will have the same effect. A region with 0 weight is
              ignored.

              If all regions have 0 weight, then no specific metering area needs to be used by the
              camera device.

              If the metering region is outside the used android.scaler.cropRegion returned in
              capture result metadata, the camera device will ignore the sections outside the crop
              region and output only the intersection rectangle as the metering region in the result
              metadata. If the region is entirely outside the crop region, it will be ignored and
              not reported in the result metadata.

          <details>This entry is normally set to IDLE, or is not
          included at all in the request settings.

          When included and set to START, the camera device will trigger the
          autofocus algorithm. If autofocus is disabled, this trigger has no effect.

          When set to CANCEL, the camera device will cancel any active trigger,
          and return to its initial AF state.

          Generally, applications should set this entry to START or CANCEL for only a
          single capture, and then return it to IDLE (or not set at all). Specifying
          START for multiple captures in a row means restarting the AF operation over
          and over again.

          See android.control.afState for what the trigger means for each AF mode.

          <details>
          When set to `true` (ON), the AWB algorithm is locked to its latest parameters,
          and will not change color balance settings until the lock is set to `false` (OFF).

          Since the camera device has a pipeline of in-flight requests, the settings that
          get locked do not necessarily correspond to the settings that were present in the
          latest capture result received from the camera device, since additional captures
          and AWB updates may have occurred even before the result was sent out. If an
          application is switching between automatic and manual control and wishes to eliminate
          any flicker during the switch, the following procedure is recommended:

            1. Starting in auto-AWB mode:
            2. Lock AWB
            3. Wait for the first result to be output that has the AWB locked
            4. Copy AWB settings from that result into a request, set the request to manual AWB
            5. Submit the capture request, proceed to run manual AWB as desired.

          Note that AWB lock is only meaningful when
          android.control.awbMode is in the AUTO mode; in other modes,
          AWB is already fixed to a specific setting.

          Some LEGACY devices may not support ON; the value is then overridden to OFF.

              The maximum number of regions supported by the device is determined by the value
              of android.control.maxRegionsAwb.

              The coordinate system is based on the active pixel array,
              with (0,0) being the top-left pixel in the active pixel array, and
              (android.sensor.info.activeArraySize.width - 1,
              android.sensor.info.activeArraySize.height - 1) being the
              bottom-right pixel in the active pixel array.

              The weight must range from 0 to 1000, and represents a weight
              for every pixel in the area. This means that a large metering area
              with the same weight as a smaller area will have more effect in
              the metering result. Metering areas can partially overlap and the
              camera device will add the weights in the overlap region.

              The weights are relative to weights of other white balance metering regions, so if
              only one region is used, all non-zero weights will have the same effect. A region with
              0 weight is ignored.

              If all regions have 0 weight, then no specific metering area needs to be used by the
              camera device.

              If the metering region is outside the used android.scaler.cropRegion returned in
              capture result metadata, the camera device will ignore the sections outside the crop
              region and output only the intersection rectangle as the metering region in the result
              metadata.  If the region is entirely outside the crop region, it will be ignored and

          <details>
          This is a top-level 3A control switch. When set to OFF, all 3A control
          by the camera device is disabled. The application must set the fields for
          capture parameters itself.

          When set to AUTO, the individual algorithm controls in
          android.control.* are in effect, such as android.control.afMode.

          When set to USE_SCENE_MODE, the individual controls in
          android.control.* are mostly disabled, and the camera device implements
          one of the scene mode settings (such as ACTION, SUNSET, or PARTY)
          as it wishes. The camera device scene mode 3A settings are provided by
          android.control.sceneModeOverrides.

          When set to OFF_KEEP_STATE, it is similar to OFF mode, the only difference
          is that this frame will not be used by camera device background 3A statistics
          update, as if this frame is never captured. This mode can be used in the scenario
          where the application doesn't want a 3A manual control capture to affect
          the subsequent auto 3A capture results.

          LEGACY mode devices will only support AUTO and USE_SCENE_MODE modes.
          LIMITED mode devices will only support OFF and OFF_KEEP_STATE if they
          support the MANUAL_SENSOR and MANUAL_POST_PROCSESING capabilities.
          FULL mode devices will always support OFF and OFF_KEEP_STATE.

            <value optional="true">HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO
              <notes>
              Optimized for high speed video recording (frame rate >=60fps) use case.

              The supported high speed video sizes and fps ranges are specified in
              android.control.availableHighSpeedVideoConfigurations. To get desired
              output frame rates, the application is only allowed to select video size
              and fps range combinations listed in this static metadata. The fps range
              can be control via android.control.aeTargetFpsRange.

              In this mode, the camera device will override aeMode, awbMode, and afMode to
              ON, ON, and CONTINUOUS_VIDEO, respectively. All post-processing block mode
              controls will be overridden to be FAST. Therefore, no manual control of capture
              and post-processing parameters is possible. All other controls operate the
              same as when android.control.mode == AUTO. This means that all other
              android.control.* fields continue to work, such as

              * android.control.aeTargetFpsRange
              * android.control.aeExposureCompensation
              * android.control.aeLock
              * android.control.awbLock
              * android.control.effectMode
              * android.control.aeRegions
              * android.control.afRegions
              * android.control.awbRegions
              * android.control.afTrigger
              * android.control.aePrecaptureTrigger

              Outside of android.control.*, the following controls will work:

              * android.flash.mode (automatic flash for still capture will not work since aeMode is ON)
              * android.lens.opticalStabilizationMode (if it is supported)
              * android.scaler.cropRegion
              * android.statistics.faceDetectMode

              For high speed recording use case, the actual maximum supported frame rate may
              be lower than what camera can output, depending on the destination Surfaces for
              the image data. For example, if the destination surface is from video encoder,
              the application need check if the video encoder is capable of supporting the
              high frame rate for a given video size, or it will end up with lower recording
              frame rate. If the destination surface is from preview window, the preview frame
              rate will be bounded by the screen refresh rate.

              The camera device will only support up to 2 output high speed streams
              (processed non-stalling format defined in android.request.maxNumOutputStreams)
              in this mode. This control will be effective only if all of below conditions are true:

              * The application created no more than maxNumHighSpeedStreams processed non-stalling
              format output streams, where maxNumHighSpeedStreams is calculated as
              min(2, android.request.maxNumOutputStreams[Processed (but not-stalling)]).
              * The stream sizes are selected from the sizes reported by
              android.control.availableHighSpeedVideoConfigurations.
              * No processed non-stalling or raw streams are configured.

              When above conditions are NOT satistied, the controls of this mode and
              android.control.aeTargetFpsRange will be ignored by the camera device,
              the camera device will fall back to android.control.mode `==` AUTO,
              and the returned capture result metadata will give the fps range choosen
              by the camera device.

              Switching into or out of this mode may trigger some camera ISP/sensor
              reconfigurations, which may introduce extra latency. It is recommended that
              the application avoids unnecessary scene mode switch as much as possible.

              <notes>
              Turn on a device-specific high dynamic range (HDR) mode.

              In this scene mode, the camera device captures images
              that keep a larger range of scene illumination levels
              visible in the final image. For example, when taking a
              picture of a object in front of a bright window, both
              the object and the scene through the window may be
              visible when using HDR mode, while in normal AUTO mode,
              one or the other may be poorly exposed. As a tradeoff,
              HDR mode generally takes much longer to capture a single
              image, has no user control, and may have other artifacts
              depending on the HDR method used.

              Therefore, HDR captures operate at a much slower rate
              than regular captures.

              In this mode, on LIMITED or FULL devices, when a request
              is made with a android.control.captureIntent of
              STILL_CAPTURE, the camera device will capture an image
              using a high dynamic range capture technique.  On LEGACY
              devices, captures that target a JPEG-format output will
              be captured with HDR, and the capture intent is not
              relevant.

              The HDR capture may involve the device capturing a burst
              of images internally and combining them into one, or it
              may involve the device using specialized high dynamic
              range capture hardware. In all cases, a single image is
              produced in response to a capture request submitted
              while in HDR mode.

              Since substantial post-processing is generally needed to
              produce an HDR image, only YUV and JPEG outputs are
              supported for LIMITED/FULL device HDR captures, and only
              JPEG outputs are supported for LEGACY HDR
              captures. Using a RAW output for HDR capture is not
              supported.

          Control for which scene mode is currently active.

          <range>android.control.availableSceneModes</range>
          <details>
          Scene modes are custom camera modes optimized for a certain set of conditions and
          capture settings.

          This is the mode that that is active when
          `android.control.mode == USE_SCENE_MODE`. Aside from FACE_PRIORITY,
          these modes will disable android.control.aeMode,
          android.control.awbMode, and android.control.afMode while in use.

          The interpretation and implementation of these scene modes is left
          to the implementor of the camera device. Their behavior will not be
          consistent across all devices, and any given device may only implement
          a subset of these modes.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          HAL implementations that include scene modes are expected to provide
          the per-scene settings to use for android.control.aeMode,
          android.control.awbMode, and android.control.afMode in
          android.control.sceneModeOverrides.

          For HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO mode, if it is included in android.control.availableSceneModes,
          the HAL must list supported video size and fps range in

          1280x720, if the HAL has two different sensor configurations for normal streaming
          mode and high speed streaming, when this scene mode is set/reset in a sequence of capture
          requests, the HAL may have to switch between different sensor modes.

          <details>
          Video stabilization automatically translates and scales images from
          the camera in order to stabilize motion between consecutive frames.

          If enabled, video stabilization can modify the
          android.scaler.cropRegion to keep the video stream stabilized.

          Switching between different video stabilization modes may take several
          frames to initialize, the camera device will report the current mode
          in capture result metadata. For example, When "ON" mode is requested,
          the video stabilization modes in the first several capture results may
          still be "OFF", and it will become "ON" when the initialization is
          done.

          If a camera device supports both this mode and OIS
          (android.lens.opticalStabilizationMode), turning both modes on may
          produce undesirable interaction, so it is recommended not to enable
          both at the same time.

            sensitivity, and frame duration.

            LEGACY mode camera devices never support OFF mode.

          settings to use with each available scene mode.
          </description>
          <range>
          For each available scene mode, the list must contain three
          entries containing the android.control.aeMode,
          android.control.awbMode, and android.control.afMode values used
          by the camera device. The entry order is `(aeMode, awbMode, afMode)`
          where aeMode has the lowest index position.
          </range>
          <details>
          When a scene mode is enabled, the camera device is expected
          to override android.control.aeMode, android.control.awbMode,
          and android.control.afMode with its preferred settings for
          that scene mode.

          The order of this list matches that of availableSceneModes,
          with 3 entries for each mode.  The overrides listed
          for FACE_PRIORITY are ignored, since for that
          mode the application-set android.control.aeMode,
          android.control.awbMode, and android.control.afMode values are
          used instead, matching the behavior when android.control.mode
          is set to AUTO. It is recommended that the FACE_PRIORITY
          overrides should be set to 0.

          For example, if availableSceneModes contains
          `(FACE_PRIORITY, ACTION, NIGHT)`,  then the camera framework
          expects sceneModeOverrides to have 9 entries formatted like:
          `(0, 0, 0, ON_AUTO_FLASH, AUTO, CONTINUOUS_PICTURE,
          ON_AUTO_FLASH, INCANDESCENT, AUTO)`.

          <hal_details>
          To maintain backward compatibility, this list will be made available
          in the static metadata of the camera service.  The camera service will
          use these values to set android.control.aeMode,
          android.control.awbMode, and android.control.afMode when using a scene
          mode other than FACE_PRIORITY.

          <description>Current state of the auto-exposure (AE) algorithm.</description>
          <details>Switching between or enabling AE modes (android.control.aeMode) always
          resets the AE state to INACTIVE. Similarly, switching between android.control.mode,
          or android.control.sceneMode if `android.control.mode == USE_SCENE_MODE` resets all
          the algorithm states to INACTIVE.

          The camera device can do several state transitions between two results, if it is
          allowed by the state transition table. For example: INACTIVE may never actually be
          seen in a result.

          The state in the result is the state for this image (in sync with this image): if
          AE state becomes CONVERGED, then the image data associated with this result should
          be good to use.

          Below are state transition tables for different AE modes.

            State       | Transition Cause | New State | Notes
          :------------:|:----------------:|:---------:|:-----------------------:
          INACTIVE      |                  | INACTIVE  | Camera device auto exposure algorithm is disabled

          When android.control.aeMode is AE_MODE_ON_*:

            State        | Transition Cause                             | New State      | Notes
          :-------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:

          SEARCHING      | Camera device finishes AE scan               | CONVERGED      | Good values, not changing
          SEARCHING      | Camera device finishes AE scan               | FLASH_REQUIRED | Converged but too dark w/o flash
          SEARCHING      | android.control.aeLock is ON                 | LOCKED         | Values locked

          LOCKED         | android.control.aeLock is OFF                | CONVERGED      | Values good after unlock
          LOCKED         | android.control.aeLock is OFF                | FLASH_REQUIRED | Exposure good, but too dark
          PRECAPTURE     | Sequence done. android.control.aeLock is OFF | CONVERGED      | Ready for high-quality capture
          PRECAPTURE     | Sequence done. android.control.aeLock is ON  | LOCKED         | Ready for high-quality capture
          Any state      | android.control.aePrecaptureTrigger is START | PRECAPTURE     | Start AE precapture metering sequence

          For the above table, the camera device may skip reporting any state changes that happen
          without application intervention (i.e. mode switch, trigger, locking). Any state that
          can be skipped in that manner is called a transient state.

          For example, for above AE modes (AE_MODE_ON_*), in addition to the state transitions
          listed in above table, it is also legal for the camera device to skip one or more
          transient states between two results. See below table for examples:

            State        | Transition Cause                                            | New State      | Notes

          Any state      | android.control.aePrecaptureTrigger is START, sequence done | FLASH_REQUIRED | Converged but too dark w/o flash after a precapture sequence, transient states are skipped by camera device.
          Any state      | android.control.aePrecaptureTrigger is START, sequence done | CONVERGED      | Converged after a precapture sequence, transient states are skipped by camera device.

          <description>Current state of auto-focus (AF) algorithm.</description>
          <details>
          Switching between or enabling AF modes (android.control.afMode) always
          resets the AF state to INACTIVE. Similarly, switching between android.control.mode,
          or android.control.sceneMode if `android.control.mode == USE_SCENE_MODE` resets all
          the algorithm states to INACTIVE.

          The camera device can do several state transitions between two results, if it is
          allowed by the state transition table. For example: INACTIVE may never actually be
          seen in a result.

          The state in the result is the state for this image (in sync with this image): if
          AF state becomes FOCUSED, then the image data associated with this result should
          be sharp.

          Below are state transition tables for different AF modes.

          When android.control.afMode is AF_MODE_OFF or AF_MODE_EDOF:

            State       | Transition Cause | New State | Notes
          :------------:|:----------------:|:---------:|:-----------:

          Any state          | Mode change      | INACTIVE           |

          For the above table, the camera device may skip reporting any state changes that happen
          without application intervention (i.e. mode switch, trigger, locking). Any state that
          can be skipped in that manner is called a transient state.

          For example, for these AF modes (AF_MODE_AUTO and AF_MODE_MACRO), in addition to the
          state transitions listed in above table, it is also legal for the camera device to skip
          one or more transient states between two results. See below table for examples:

          When switch between AF_MODE_CONTINUOUS_* (CAF modes) and AF_MODE_AUTO/AF_MODE_MACRO

          <description>Current state of auto-white balance (AWB) algorithm.</description>
          <details>Switching between or enabling AWB modes (android.control.awbMode) always
          resets the AWB state to INACTIVE. Similarly, switching between android.control.mode,
          or android.control.sceneMode if `android.control.mode == USE_SCENE_MODE` resets all
          the algorithm states to INACTIVE.

          The camera device can do several state transitions between two results, if it is
          allowed by the state transition table. So INACTIVE may never actually be seen in
          a result.

          The state in the result is the state for this image (in sync with this image): if
          AWB state becomes CONVERGED, then the image data associated with this result should
          be good to use.

          Below are state transition tables for different AWB modes.

          When `android.control.awbMode != AWB_MODE_AUTO`:

            State       | Transition Cause | New State | Notes
          :------------:|:----------------:|:---------:|:-----------------------:
          INACTIVE      |                  |INACTIVE   |Camera device auto white balance algorithm is disabled

          When android.control.awbMode is AWB_MODE_AUTO:

            State        | Transition Cause                 | New State     | Notes
          :-------------:|:--------------------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:
          INACTIVE       | Camera device initiates AWB scan | SEARCHING     | Values changing
          INACTIVE       | android.control.awbLock is ON    | LOCKED        | Values locked
          SEARCHING      | Camera device finishes AWB scan  | CONVERGED     | Good values, not changing
          SEARCHING      | android.control.awbLock is ON    | LOCKED        | Values locked
          CONVERGED      | Camera device initiates AWB scan | SEARCHING     | Values changing
          CONVERGED      | android.control.awbLock is ON    | LOCKED        | Values locked
          LOCKED         | android.control.awbLock is OFF   | SEARCHING     | Values not good after unlock

          For the above table, the camera device may skip reporting any state changes that happen
          without application intervention (i.e. mode switch, trigger, locking). Any state that
          can be skipped in that manner is called a transient state.

          For example, for this AWB mode (AWB_MODE_AUTO), in addition to the state transitions
          listed in above table, it is also legal for the camera device to skip one or more
          transient states between two results. See below table for examples:

            State        | Transition Cause                 | New State     | Notes
          :-------------:|:--------------------------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:
          INACTIVE       | Camera device finished AWB scan  | CONVERGED     | Values are already good, transient states are skipped by camera device.
          LOCKED         | android.control.awbLock is OFF   | CONVERGED     | Values good after unlock, transient states are skipped by camera device.

          List of available high speed video size and fps range configurations
          supported by the camera device, in the format of (width, height, fps_min, fps_max).
          </description>
          <range>
          For each configuration, the fps_max &amp;gt;= 60fps.
          </range>
          <details>
          When HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO is supported in android.control.availableSceneModes,
          this metadata will list the supported high speed video size and fps range
          configurations. All the sizes listed in this configuration will be a subset
          of the sizes reported by StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputSizes for processed
          non-stalling formats.

          For the high speed video use case, where the application will set
          android.control.sceneMode to HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO in capture requests, the application must
          select the video size and fps range from this metadata to configure the recording and
          preview streams and setup the recording requests. For example, if the application intends
          to do high speed recording, it can select the maximum size reported by this metadata to
          configure output streams. Once the size is selected, application can filter this metadata
          by selected size and get the supported fps ranges, and use these fps ranges to setup the
          recording requests. Note that for the use case of multiple output streams, application
          must select one unique size from this metadata to use. Otherwise a request error might
          occur.

          For normal video recording use case, where some application will NOT set
          android.control.sceneMode to HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO in capture requests, the fps ranges
          reported in this metadata must not be used to setup capture requests, or it will cause
          request error.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          All the sizes listed in this configuration will be a subset of the sizes reported by
          android.scaler.availableStreamConfigurations for processed non-stalling output formats.
          Note that for all high speed video configurations, HAL must be able to support a minimum
          of two streams, though the application might choose to configure just one stream.

          Since the HIGH_SPEED_VIDEO mode may be turned on for preview view only case, the preview
          fps is bounded by device refresh rate (e.g. 60fps). For a given resolution, it is
          recommended that this list includes some fps ranges (e.g. [30, 60]) that is suitable
          for preview only streaming case.

          <details>
          This control is only effective when flash unit is available
          (`android.flash.info.available == true`).

          When this control is used, the android.control.aeMode must be set to ON or OFF.
          Otherwise, the camera device auto-exposure related flash control (ON_AUTO_FLASH,
          ON_ALWAYS_FLASH, or ON_AUTO_FLASH_REDEYE) will override this control.

          When set to OFF, the camera device will not fire flash for this capture.

          When set to SINGLE, the camera device will fire flash regardless of the camera
          device's auto-exposure routine's result. When used in still capture case, this
          control should be used along with auto-exposure (AE) precapture metering sequence
          (android.control.aePrecaptureTrigger), otherwise, the image may be incorrectly exposed.

          When set to TORCH, the flash will be on continuously. This mode can be used
          for use cases such as preview, auto-focus assist, still capture, or video recording.

          The flash status will be reported by android.flash.state in the capture result metadata.

          The clockwise rotation angle in degrees, relative to the orientation
          to the camera, that the JPEG picture needs to be rotated by, to be viewed
          upright.

          Camera devices may either encode this value into the JPEG EXIF header, or
          rotate the image data to match this orientation.

          Note that this orientation is relative to the orientation of the camera sensor, given
          by android.sensor.orientation.

          To translate from the device orientation given by the Android sensor APIs, the following
          sample code may be used:

              private int getJpegOrientation(CameraCharacteristics c, int deviceOrientation) {
                  if (deviceOrientation == android.view.OrientationEventListener.ORIENTATION_UNKNOWN) return 0;
                  int sensorOrientation = c.get(CameraCharacteristics.SENSOR_ORIENTATION);

                  // Round device orientation to a multiple of 90
                  deviceOrientation = (deviceOrientation + 45) / 90 * 90;

                  // Reverse device orientation for front-facing cameras
                  boolean facingFront = c.get(CameraCharacteristics.LENS_FACING) == CameraCharacteristics.LENS_FACING_FRONT;
                  if (facingFront) deviceOrientation = -deviceOrientation;

                  // Calculate desired JPEG orientation relative to camera orientation to make
                  // the image upright relative to the device orientation
                  int jpegOrientation = (sensorOrientation + deviceOrientation + 360) % 360;

                  return jpegOrientation;

          <details>When set to (0, 0) value, the JPEG EXIF will not contain thumbnail,
          but the captured JPEG will still be a valid image.

          For best results, when issuing a request for a JPEG image, the thumbnail size selected
          should have the same aspect ratio as the main JPEG output.

          If the thumbnail image aspect ratio differs from the JPEG primary image aspect
          ratio, the camera device creates the thumbnail by cropping it from the primary image.
          For example, if the primary image has 4:3 aspect ratio, the thumbnail image has
          16:9 aspect ratio, the primary image will be cropped vertically (letterbox) to
          generate the thumbnail image. The thumbnail image will always have a smaller Field
          Of View (FOV) than the primary image when aspect ratios differ.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          The HAL must not squeeze or stretch the downscaled primary image to generate thumbnail.
          The cropping must be done on the primary jpeg image rather than the sensor active array.
          The stream cropping rule specified by "S5. Cropping" in camera3.h doesn't apply to the
          thumbnail image cropping.

          Lens filters are typically used to lower the amount of light the
          sensor is exposed to (measured in steps of EV). As used here, an EV
          step is the standard logarithmic representation, which are
          non-negative, and inversely proportional to the amount of light
          hitting the sensor.  For example, setting this to 0 would result
          in no reduction of the incoming light, and setting this to 2 would
          mean that the filter is set to reduce incoming light by two stops
          (allowing 1/4 of the prior amount of light to the sensor).

          It may take several frames before the lens filter density changes
          to the requested value. While the filter density is still changing,
          android.lens.state will be set to MOVING.

          A value of `0.0f` means infinity focus. The value set will be clamped to

          Like android.lens.focalLength, this setting won't be applied

          Sets whether the camera device uses optical image stabilization (OIS)

          <range>android.lens.info.availableOpticalStabilization</range>
          <details>
          OIS is used to compensate for motion blur due to small
          movements of the camera during capture. Unlike digital image
          stabilization (android.control.videoStabilizationMode), OIS
          makes use of mechanical elements to stabilize the camera
          sensor, and thus allows for longer exposure times before
          camera shake becomes apparent.

          Switching between different optical stabilization modes may take several
          frames to initialize, the camera device will report the current mode in
          capture result metadata. For example, When "ON" mode is requested, the
          optical stabilization modes in the first several capture results may still
          be "OFF", and it will become "ON" when the initialization is done.

          If a camera device supports both OIS and digital image stabilization
          (android.control.videoStabilizationMode), turning both modes on may produce undesirable
          interaction, so it is recommended not to enable both at the same time.

          Not all devices will support OIS; see
          android.lens.info.availableOpticalStabilization for
          available controls.

            <description>The lens focus distance calibration quality.</description>
            <details>
            The lens focus distance calibration quality determines the reliability of
            focus related metadata entries, i.e. android.lens.focusDistance,
            android.lens.focusRange, android.lens.info.hyperfocalDistance, and
            android.lens.info.minimumFocusDistance.

            APPROXIMATE and CALIBRATED devices report the focus metadata in
            units of diopters (1/meter), so `0.0f` represents focusing at infinity,
            and increasing positive numbers represent focusing closer and closer
            to the camera device. The focus distance control also uses diopters
            on these devices.

            UNCALIBRATED devices do not use units that are directly comparable
            to any real physical measurement, but `0.0f` still represents farthest
            focus, and android.lens.info.minimumFocusDistance represents the
            nearest focus the device can achieve.
            </details>
            <hal_details>
            For devices advertise APPROXIMATE quality or higher, diopters 0 (infinity
            focus) must work. When autofocus is disabled (android.control.afMode == OFF)
            and the lens focus distance is set to 0 diopters
            (android.lens.focusDistance == 0), the lens will move to focus at infinity
            and is stably focused at infinity even if the device tilts. It may take the
            lens some time to move; during the move the lens state should be MOVING and
            the output diopter value should be changing toward 0.

          For lens parameters android.lens.focalLength, android.lens.focusDistance,
          android.lens.filterDensity and android.lens.aperture, when changes are requested,
          they may take several frames to reach the requested values. This state indicates
          the current status of the lens parameters.

          When the state is STATIONARY, the lens parameters are not changing. This could be
          either because the parameters are all fixed, or because the lens has had enough
          time to reach the most recently-requested values.
          If all these lens parameters are not changable for a camera device, as listed below:

          * Fixed focus (`android.lens.info.minimumFocusDistance == 0`), which means
          android.lens.focusDistance parameter will always be 0.
          * Fixed focal length (android.lens.info.availableFocalLengths contains single value),
          which means the optical zoom is not supported.
          * No ND filter (android.lens.info.availableFilterDensities contains only 0).
          * Fixed aperture (android.lens.info.availableApertures contains single value).

          Then this state will always be STATIONARY.

          When the state is MOVING, it indicates that at least one of the lens parameters
          is changing.

              The camera device supports basic manual control of the sensor image
              acquisition related stages. This means the following controls are
              guaranteed to be supported:

              * Manual frame duration control
                  * android.sensor.frameDuration
                  * android.sensor.info.maxFrameDuration
              * Manual exposure control
                  * android.sensor.exposureTime
                  * android.sensor.info.exposureTimeRange

              * Manual black level locking
                  * android.blackLevel.lock

              If any of the above 3A algorithms are enabled, then the camera

              * Manual white balance control
                  * android.colorCorrection.transform
                  * android.colorCorrection.gains
              * Manual lens shading map control

                    * android.colorCorrection.aberrationMode
                    * android.colorCorrection.availableAberrationModes

              If auto white balance is enabled, then the camera device
              will accurately report the values applied by AWB in the result.

              A given camera device may also support additional post-processing
              controls, but this capability only covers the above list of controls.

              <notes>
              The camera device supports accurately reporting the sensor settings for many of
              the sensor controls while the built-in 3A algorithm is running.  This allows
              reporting of sensor settings even when these settings cannot be manually changed.

              The values reported for the following controls are guaranteed to be available
              in the CaptureResult, including when 3A is enabled:

              * Exposure control
                  * android.sensor.exposureTime
              * Sensitivity control
                  * android.sensor.sensitivity

                  * android.lens.focusDistance
                  * android.lens.aperture

              This capability is a subset of the MANUAL_SENSOR control capability, and will
              always be included if the MANUAL_SENSOR capability is available.

          advertises as fully supporting.</description>
          <details>
          A capability is a contract that the camera device makes in order
          to be able to satisfy one or more use cases.

          Listing a capability guarantees that the whole set of features
          required to support a common use will all be available.

          Using a subset of the functionality provided by an unsupported
          capability may be possible on a specific camera device implementation;
          to do this query each of android.request.availableRequestKeys,
          android.request.availableResultKeys,
          android.request.availableCharacteristicsKeys.

          The following capabilities are guaranteed to be available on
          android.info.supportedHardwareLevel `==` FULL devices:

          * MANUAL_SENSOR
          * MANUAL_POST_PROCESSING

          Other capabilities may be available on either FULL or LIMITED
          devices, but the application should query this key to be sure.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          Additional constraint details per-capability will be available
          in the Compatibility Test Suite.

          Minimum baseline requirements required for the
          BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE capability are not explicitly listed.
          Instead refer to "BC" tags and the camera CTS tests in the
          android.hardware.camera2.cts package.

          Listed controls that can be either request or result (e.g.
          android.sensor.exposureTime) must be available both in the
          request and the result in order to be considered to be
          capability-compliant.

          For example, if the HAL claims to support MANUAL control,
          then exposure time must be configurable via the request _and_
          the actual exposure applied must be available via
          the result.

          If MANUAL_SENSOR is omitted, the HAL may choose to omit the
          android.scaler.availableMinFrameDurations static property entirely.

          android.sensor.info.activeArraySize</units>
          <details>
            This control can be used to implement digital zoom.

            The crop region coordinate system is based off
            android.sensor.info.activeArraySize, with `(0, 0)` being the
            top-left corner of the sensor active array.

            Output streams use this rectangle to produce their output,
            cropping to a smaller region if necessary to maintain the
            stream's aspect ratio, then scaling the sensor input to
            match the output's configured resolution.

            The crop region is applied after the RAW to other color
            space (e.g. YUV) conversion. Since raw streams
            (e.g. RAW16) don't have the conversion stage, they are not
            croppable. The crop region will be ignored by raw streams.

            For non-raw streams, any additional per-stream cropping will
            be done to maximize the final pixel area of the stream.

            For example, if the crop region is set to a 4:3 aspect
            ratio, then 4:3 streams will use the exact crop
            region. 16:9 streams will further crop vertically
            (letterbox).

            Conversely, if the crop region is set to a 16:9, then 4:3
            outputs will crop horizontally (pillarbox), and 16:9
            streams will match exactly. These additional crops will
            be centered within the crop region.

            The width and height of the crop region cannot
            be set to be smaller than
            `floor( activeArraySize.width / android.scaler.availableMaxDigitalZoom )` and
            `floor( activeArraySize.height / android.scaler.availableMaxDigitalZoom )`, respectively.

            The camera device may adjust the crop region to account
            for rounding and other hardware requirements; the final
            crop region used will be included in the output capture
            result.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
            The output streams must maintain square pixels at all
            times, no matter what the relative aspect ratios of the
            crop region and the stream are.  Negative values for
            corner are allowed for raw output if full pixel array is
            larger than active pixel array. Width and height may be
            rounded to nearest larger supportable width, especially
            for raw output, where only a few fixed scales may be
            possible.

              RAW16 is a standard, cross-platform format for raw image
              buffers with 16-bit pixels.

              Buffers of this format are typically expected to have a
              Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) layout, which is given in
              android.sensor.info.colorFilterArrangement. Sensors with
              CFAs that are not representable by a format in
              android.sensor.info.colorFilterArrangement should not
              use this format.

              Buffers of this format will also follow the constraints given for
              RAW_OPAQUE buffers, but with relaxed performance constraints.

              See android.scaler.availableInputOutputFormatsMap for

              <notes>
              RAW_OPAQUE is a format for raw image buffers coming from an
              image sensor.

              The actual structure of buffers of this format is
              platform-specific, but must follow several constraints:

              1. No image post-processing operations may have been applied to
              buffers of this type. These buffers contain raw image data coming
              directly from the image sensor.
              1. If a buffer of this format is passed to the camera device for
              reprocessing, the resulting images will be identical to the images
              produced if the buffer had come directly from the sensor and was
              processed with the same settings.

              The intended use for this format is to allow access to the native
              raw format buffers coming directly from the camera sensor without
              any additional conversions or decrease in framerate.

              See android.scaler.availableInputOutputFormatsMap for the full set of
              performance guarantees.

          </details>
          <hal_details>
          These format values are from HAL_PIXEL_FORMAT_* in
          system/core/include/system/graphics.h.

          When IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED is used, the platform
          gralloc module will select a format based on the usage flags provided
          by the camera HAL device and the other endpoint of the stream. It is
          usually used by preview and recording streams, where the application doesn't
          need access the image data.

          YCbCr_420_888 format must be supported by the HAL. When an image stream
          needs CPU/application direct access, this format will be used.

          The BLOB format must be supported by the HAL. This is used for the JPEG stream.

          A RAW_OPAQUE buffer should contain only pixel data. It is strongly
          recommended that any information used by the camera device when
          processing images is fully expressed by the result metadata
          for that image buffer.

          The resolutions are listed as `(width, height)` pairs.

          For a given use case, the actual maximum supported resolution
          may be lower than what is listed here, depending on the destination

          the video encoder chosen may have a maximum size limit (e.g. 1080p)
          smaller than what the camera (e.g. maximum resolution is 3264x2448)
          can provide.

          Please reference the documentation for the image data destination to

          <description>The mapping of image formats that are supported by this
          camera device for input streams, to their corresponding output formats.
          </description>
          <details>
          All camera devices with at least 1
          android.request.maxNumInputStreams will have at least one
          available input format.

          The camera device will support the following map of formats,
          if its dependent capability is supported:

            Input Format  | Output Format    | Capability
          :---------------|:-----------------|:----------
          RAW_OPAQUE      | JPEG             | ZSL
          RAW_OPAQUE      | YUV_420_888      | ZSL
          RAW_OPAQUE      | RAW16            | RAW
          RAW16           | YUV_420_888      | RAW
          RAW16           | JPEG             | RAW

          For ZSL-capable camera devices, using the RAW_OPAQUE format
          as either input or output will never hurt maximum frame rate (i.e.
          StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputStallDuration(int,Size)
          for a `format =` RAW_OPAQUE is always 0).

          Attempting to configure an input stream with output streams not
          listed as available in this map is not valid.

          TODO: typedef to ReprocessFormatMap
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          For the formats, see `system/core/include/system/graphics.h` for a definition
          of the image format enumerations.

          This value is encoded as a variable-size array-of-arrays.
          The inner array always contains `[format, length, ...]` where
          `...` has `length` elements. An inner array is followed by another
          inner array if the total metadata entry size hasn't yet been exceeded.

          A code sample to read/write this encoding (with a device that
          supports reprocessing RAW_OPAQUE to RAW16, YUV_420_888, and JPEG,
          and reprocessing RAW16 to YUV_420_888 and JPEG):

              // reading
              int32_t* contents = &amp;entry.i32[0];
              for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; entry.count; ) {
                  int32_t format = contents[i++];
                  int32_t length = contents[i++];
                  int32_t output_formats[length];
                  memcpy(&amp;output_formats[0], &amp;contents[i],
                         length * sizeof(int32_t));
                  i += length;
              }

              // writing (static example, RAW+ZSL)
              int32_t[] contents = {
                RAW_OPAQUE, 3, RAW16, YUV_420_888, BLOB,
                RAW16, 2, YUV_420_888, BLOB,
              };

                    sizeof(contents)/sizeof(contents[0]), &amp;updated_entry);

          If the HAL claims to support any of the capabilities listed in the
          above details, then it must also support all the input-output
          combinations listed for that capability. It can optionally support

          can provide.

          Please reference the documentation for the image data destination to
          check if it limits the maximum size for image data.

          Not all output formats may be supported in a configuration with
          an input stream of a particular format. For more details, see

          <hal_details>
          It is recommended (but not mandatory) to also include half/quarter
          of sensor maximum resolution for JPEG formats (regardless of hardware
          level).

          (The following is a rewording of the above required table):

          For JPEG format, the sizes may be restricted by below conditions:

          * The HAL may choose the aspect ratio of each Jpeg size to be one of well known ones
          (e.g. 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 etc.). If the sensor maximum resolution
          (defined by android.sensor.info.activeArraySize) has an aspect ratio other than these,
          it does not have to be included in the supported JPEG sizes.
          * Some hardware JPEG encoders may have pixel boundary alignment requirements, such as
          the dimensions being a multiple of 16.

          Therefore, the maximum JPEG size may be smaller than sensor maximum resolution.
          However, the largest JPEG size must be as close as possible to the sensor maximum
          resolution given above constraints. It is required that after aspect ratio adjustments,
          additional size reduction due to other issues must be less than 3% in area. For example,
          if the sensor maximum resolution is 3280x2464, if the maximum JPEG size has aspect
          ratio 4:3, the JPEG encoder alignment requirement is 16, the maximum JPEG size will be
          3264x2448.

          For FULL capability devices (`android.info.supportedHardwareLevel == FULL`),
          the HAL must include all YUV_420_888 sizes that have JPEG sizes listed
          here as output streams.

          It must also include each below resolution if it is smaller than or
          equal to the sensor maximum resolution (for both YUV_420_888 and JPEG
          formats), as output streams:

          * 240p (320 x 240)
          * 480p (640 x 480)
          * 720p (1280 x 720)
          * 1080p (1920 x 1080)

          For LIMITED capability devices
          (`android.info.supportedHardwareLevel == LIMITED`),
          the HAL only has to list up to the maximum video size
          supported by the device.

          Regardless of hardware level, every output resolution available for
          YUV_420_888 must also be available for IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED.

          This supercedes the following fields, which are now deprecated:

          This should correspond to the frame duration when only that

          set to either OFF or FAST.

          When multiple streams are used in a request, the minimum frame
          duration will be max(individual stream min durations).

          The minimum frame duration of a stream (of a particular format, size)
          is the same regardless of whether the stream is input or output.

          See android.sensor.frameDuration and

          calculating the max frame rate.

          A stall duration is how much extra time would get added
          to the normal minimum frame duration for a repeating request
          that has streams with non-zero stall.

          For example, consider JPEG captures which have the following
          characteristics:

          * JPEG streams act like processed YUV streams in requests for which
          they are not included; in requests in which they are directly
          referenced, they act as JPEG streams. This is because supporting a
          JPEG stream requires the underlying YUV data to always be ready for
          use by a JPEG encoder, but the encoder will only be used (and impact
          frame duration) on requests that actually reference a JPEG stream.
          * The JPEG processor can run concurrently to the rest of the camera
          pipeline, but cannot process more than 1 capture at a time.

          In other words, using a repeating YUV request would result
          in a steady frame rate (let's say it's 30 FPS). If a single
          JPEG request is submitted periodically, the frame rate will stay
          at 30 FPS (as long as we wait for the previous JPEG to return each
          time). If we try to submit a repeating YUV + JPEG request, then
          the frame rate will drop from 30 FPS.

          In general, submitting a new request with a non-0 stall time
          stream will _not_ cause a frame rate drop unless there are still
          outstanding buffers for that stream from previous requests.

          Submitting a repeating request with streams (call this `S`)
          is the same as setting the minimum frame duration from
          the normal minimum frame duration corresponding to `S`, added with
          the maximum stall duration for `S`.

          If interleaving requests with and without a stall duration,
          a request will stall by the maximum of the remaining times
          for each can-stall stream with outstanding buffers.

          This means that a stalling request will not have an exposure start
          until the stall has completed.

          This should correspond to the stall duration when only that stream is
          active, with all processing (typically in android.*.mode) set to FAST
          or OFF. Setting any of the processing modes to HIGH_QUALITY
          effectively results in an indeterminate stall duration for all
          streams in a request (the regular stall calculation rules are
          ignored).

          The following formats may always have a stall duration:

          * ImageFormat#JPEG
          * ImageFormat#RAW_SENSOR

          The following formats will never have a stall duration:

          * ImageFormat#YUV_420_888

          All other formats may or may not have an allowed stall duration on
          a per-capability basis; refer to android.request.availableCapabilities
          for more details.

          See android.sensor.frameDuration for more information about
          calculating the max frame rate (absent stalls).

          StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputStallDuration(int, Size) )
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          If possible, it is recommended that all non-JPEG formats
          (such as RAW16) should not have a stall duration. RAW10, RAW_OPAQUE and
          IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED must not have stall durations.

          Do not set this property directly
          (it is synthetic and will not be available at the HAL layer);
          set the android.scaler.availableStreamConfigurations instead.

          Not all output formats may be supported in a configuration with
          an input stream of a particular format. For more details, see
          android.scaler.availableInputOutputFormatsMap.

          It is recommended (but not mandatory) to also include half/quarter
          of sensor maximum resolution for JPEG formats (regardless of hardware
          level).

          (The following is a rewording of the above required table):

          The HAL must include sensor maximum resolution (defined by
          android.sensor.info.activeArraySize).

          For FULL capability devices (`android.info.supportedHardwareLevel == FULL`),
          the HAL must include all YUV_420_888 sizes that have JPEG sizes listed
          here as output streams.

          It must also include each below resolution if it is smaller than or
          equal to the sensor maximum resolution (for both YUV_420_888 and JPEG
          formats), as output streams:

          * 240p (320 x 240)
          * 480p (640 x 480)
          * 720p (1280 x 720)
          * 1080p (1920 x 1080)

          For LIMITED capability devices
          (`android.info.supportedHardwareLevel == LIMITED`),
          the HAL only has to list up to the maximum video size
          supported by the device.

          Regardless of hardware level, every output resolution available for
          YUV_420_888 must also be available for IMPLEMENTATION_DEFINED.

          This supercedes the following fields, which are now deprecated:

          * availableFormats
          * available[Processed,Raw,Jpeg]Sizes

          <details>
          When passing a non-centered crop region (android.scaler.cropRegion) to a camera
          device that only supports CENTER_ONLY cropping, the camera device will move the
          crop region to the center of the sensor active array (android.sensor.info.activeArraySize)
          and keep the crop region width and height unchanged. The camera device will return the
          final used crop region in metadata result android.scaler.cropRegion.

          Camera devices that support FREEFORM cropping will support any crop region that
          is inside of the active array. The camera device will apply the same crop region and
          return the final used crop region in capture result metadata android.scaler.cropRegion.

          FULL capability devices (android.info.supportedHardwareLevel `==` FULL) will support
          FREEFORM cropping. LEGACY capability devices will only support CENTER_ONLY cropping.

          <details>
          The maximum frame rate that can be supported by a camera subsystem is
          a function of many factors:

          * Requested resolutions of output image streams
          * Availability of binning / skipping modes on the imager
          * The bandwidth of the imager interface
          * The bandwidth of the various ISP processing blocks

          Since these factors can vary greatly between different ISPs and
          sensors, the camera abstraction tries to represent the bandwidth
          restrictions with as simple a model as possible.

          The model presented has the following characteristics:

          * The image sensor is always configured to output the smallest
          resolution possible given the application's requested output stream
          sizes.  The smallest resolution is defined as being at least as large
          as the largest requested output stream size; the camera pipeline must
          never digitally upsample sensor data when the crop region covers the
          whole sensor. In general, this means that if only small output stream
          resolutions are configured, the sensor can provide a higher frame
          rate.
          * Since any request may use any or all the currently configured
          output streams, the sensor and ISP must be configured to support
          scaling a single capture to all the streams at the same time.  This
          means the camera pipeline must be ready to produce the largest
          requested output size without any delay.  Therefore, the overall
          frame rate of a given configured stream set is governed only by the
          largest requested stream resolution.
          * Using more than one output stream in a request does not affect the
          frame duration.
          * Certain format-streams may need to do additional background processing
          before data is consumed/produced by that stream. These processors
          can run concurrently to the rest of the camera pipeline, but
          cannot process more than 1 capture at a time.

          The necessary information for the application, given the model above,
          is provided via the android.scaler.streamConfigurationMap field
          using StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputMinFrameDuration(int, Size).
          These are used to determine the maximum frame rate / minimum frame
          duration that is possible for a given stream configuration.

          Specifically, the application can use the following rules to
          determine the minimum frame duration it can request from the camera
          device:

          1. Let the set of currently configured input/output streams
          be called `S`.
          1. Find the minimum frame durations for each stream in `S`, by
          looking it up in android.scaler.streamConfigurationMap using
          StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputMinFrameDuration(int, Size) (with
          its respective size/format). Let this set of frame durations be called
          `F`.
          1. For any given request `R`, the minimum frame duration allowed
          for `R` is the maximum out of all values in `F`. Let the streams
          used in `R` be called `S_r`.

          If none of the streams in `S_r` have a stall time (listed in
          StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputStallDuration(int,Size) using its
          respective size/format), then the frame duration in
          `F` determines the steady state frame rate that the application will
          get if it uses `R` as a repeating request. Let this special kind
          of request be called `Rsimple`.

          A repeating request `Rsimple` can be _occasionally_ interleaved
          by a single capture of a new request `Rstall` (which has at least
          one in-use stream with a non-0 stall time) and if `Rstall` has the
          same minimum frame duration this will not cause a frame rate loss
          if all buffers from the previous `Rstall` have already been
          delivered.

          For more details about stalling, see
          StreamConfigurationMap#getOutputStallDuration(int,Size).

          This control is only effective if android.control.aeMode or android.control.mode is set to
          OFF; otherwise the auto-exposure algorithm will override this value.

            sample values from the sensor.  This is typically caused by the
            sensor becoming highly non-linear or clipping. The minimum for
            each channel is specified by the offset in the
            android.sensor.blackLevelPattern key.

            The white level is typically determined either by sensor bit depth
            (8-14 bits is expected), or by the point where the sensor response
            becomes too non-linear to be useful.  The default value for this is
            maximum representable value for a 16-bit raw sample (2^16 - 1).
            </details>
            <hal_details>
            The full bit depth of the sensor must be available in the raw data,
            so the value for linear sensors should not be significantly lower
            than maximum raw value supported, i.e. 2^(sensor bits per pixel).

          The standard reference illuminant used as the scene light source when

          android.sensor.calibrationTransform1, and

          The values in this key correspond to the values defined for the
          EXIF LightSource tag. These illuminants are standard light sources
          that are often used calibrating camera devices.

          If this key is present, then android.sensor.colorTransform1,
          android.sensor.calibrationTransform1, and
          android.sensor.forwardMatrix1 will also be present.

          Some devices may choose to provide a second set of calibration
          information for improved quality, including
          android.sensor.referenceIlluminant2 and its corresponding matrices.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          The first reference illuminant (android.sensor.referenceIlluminant1)
          and corresponding matrices must be present to support the RAW capability
          and DNG output.

          When producing raw images with a color profile that has only been
          calibrated against a single light source, it is valid to omit
          android.sensor.referenceIlluminant2 along with the
          android.sensor.colorTransform2, android.sensor.calibrationTransform2,
          and android.sensor.forwardMatrix2 matrices.

          If only android.sensor.referenceIlluminant1 is included, it should be
          chosen so that it is representative of typical scene lighting.  In
          general, D50 or DAYLIGHT will be chosen for this case.

          If both android.sensor.referenceIlluminant1 and
          android.sensor.referenceIlluminant2 are included, they should be
          chosen to represent the typical range of scene lighting conditions.
          In general, low color temperature illuminant such as Standard-A will
          be chosen for the first reference illuminant and a higher color
          temperature illuminant such as D65 will be chosen for the second
          reference illuminant.

          When android.sensor.info.timestampSource `==` UNKNOWN,
          the timestamps measure time since an unspecified starting point,
          and are monotonically increasing. They can be compared with the
          timestamps for other captures from the same camera device, but are
          not guaranteed to be comparable to any other time source.

          When android.sensor.info.timestampSource `==` REALTIME,
          the timestamps measure time in the same timebase as
          android.os.SystemClock#elapsedRealtimeNanos(), and they can be
          compared to other timestamps from other subsystems that are using
          that base.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          All timestamps must be in reference to the kernel's
          CLOCK_BOOTTIME monotonic clock, which properly accounts for
          time spent asleep. This allows for synchronization with
          sensors that continue to operate while the system is
          otherwise asleep.

          If android.sensor.info.timestampSource `==` REALTIME,
          The timestamp must be synchronized with the timestamps from other
          sensor subsystems that are using the same timebase.

          This key contains two noise model coefficients for each CFA channel
          corresponding to the sensor amplification (S) and sensor readout
          noise (O).  These are given as pairs of coefficients for each channel
          in the same order as channels listed for the CFA layout key
          (see android.sensor.info.colorFilterArrangement).  This is
          represented as an array of Pair&amp;lt;Double, Double&amp;gt;, where
          the first member of the Pair at index n is the S coefficient and the
          second member is the O coefficient for the nth color channel in the CFA.

          These coefficients are used in a two parameter noise model to describe
          the amount of noise present in the image for each CFA channel.  The
          noise model used here is:

          N(x) = sqrt(Sx + O)

          Where x represents the recorded signal of a CFA channel normalized to
          the range [0, 1], and S and O are the noise model coeffiecients for
          that channel.

          A more detailed description of the noise model can be found in the
          Adobe DNG specification for the NoiseProfile tag.

          The worst-case divergence between Bayer green channels.

          &amp;gt;= 0
          </range>
          <details>
          This value is an estimate of the worst case split between the
          Bayer green channels in the red and blue rows in the sensor color
          filter array.

          The green split is calculated as follows:

          1. A 5x5 pixel (or larger) window W within the active sensor array is
          chosen. The term 'pixel' here is taken to mean a group of 4 Bayer
          mosaic channels (R, Gr, Gb, B).  The location and size of the window
          chosen is implementation defined, and should be chosen to provide a
          green split estimate that is both representative of the entire image
          for this camera sensor, and can be calculated quickly.
          1. The arithmetic mean of the green channels from the red
          rows (mean_Gr) within W is computed.
          1. The arithmetic mean of the green channels from the blue
          rows (mean_Gb) within W is computed.
          1. The maximum ratio R of the two means is computed as follows:
          `R = max((mean_Gr + 1)/(mean_Gb + 1), (mean_Gb + 1)/(mean_Gr + 1))`

          The ratio R is the green split divergence reported for this property,
          which represents how much the green channels differ in the mosaic
          pattern.  This value is typically used to determine the treatment of
          the green mosaic channels when demosaicing.

          The green split value can be roughly interpreted as follows:

          * R &amp;lt; 1.03 is a negligible split (&amp;lt;3% divergence).
          * 1.20 &amp;lt;= R &amp;gt;= 1.03 will require some software
          correction to avoid demosaic errors (3-20% divergence).
          * R &amp;gt; 1.20 will require strong software correction to produce
          a usuable image (&amp;gt;20% divergence).
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          The green split given may be a static value based on prior
          characterization of the camera sensor using the green split
          calculation method given here over a large, representative, sample
          set of images.  Other methods of calculation that produce equivalent
          results, and can be interpreted in the same manner, may be used.

          Each color channel is treated as an unsigned 32-bit integer.
          The camera device then uses the most significant X bits
          that correspond to how many bits are in its Bayer raw sensor
          output.

          For example, a sensor with RAW10 Bayer output would use the

              The vertical bars (left-to-right) are as follows:

              * 100% white
              * yellow
              * cyan
              * green

              * red
              * blue
              * black

              In general the image would look like the following:

                 W Y C G M R B K
                 W Y C G M R B K
                 W Y C G M R B K
                 W Y C G M R B K
                 W Y C G M R B K
                 . . . . . . . .
                 . . . . . . . .
                 . . . . . . . .

                 (B = Blue, K = Black)

             Each bar should take up 1/8 of the sensor pixel array width.
             When this is not possible, the bar size should be rounded
             down to the nearest integer and the pattern can repeat
             on the right side.

             Each bar's height must always take up the full sensor
             pixel array height.

             Each pixel in this test pattern must be set to either
             0% intensity or 100% intensity.

            <value>COLOR_BARS_FADE_TO_GRAY
              <notes>
              The test pattern is similar to COLOR_BARS, except that
              each bar should start at its specified color at the top,
              and fade to gray at the bottom.

              Furthermore each bar is further subdivided into a left and
              right half. The left half should have a smooth gradient,
              and the right half should have a quantized gradient.

              In particular, the right half's should consist of blocks of the
              same color for 1/16th active sensor pixel array width.

              The least significant bits in the quantized gradient should
              be copied from the most significant bits of the smooth gradient.

              The height of each bar should always be a multiple of 128.
              When this is not the case, the pattern should repeat at the bottom
              of the image.

              The generator should be reset at the beginning of each frame,

          When set to other modes, lens shading correction will be applied by the camera
          device. Applications can request lens shading map data by setting
          android.statistics.lensShadingMapMode to ON, and then the camera device will provide lens
          shading map data in android.statistics.lensShadingCorrectionMap; the returned shading map
          data will be the one applied by the camera device for this capture request.

          The shading map data may depend on the auto-exposure (AE) and AWB statistics, therefore
          the reliability of the map data may be affected by the AE and AWB algorithms. When AE and
          AWB are in AUTO modes(android.control.aeMode `!=` OFF and android.control.awbMode `!=`
          OFF), to get best results, it is recommended that the applications wait for the AE and AWB
          to be converged before using the returned shading map data.

          <details>The least shaded section of the image should have a gain factor

          When android.colorCorrection.mode = TRANSFORM_MATRIX, the map
          must take into account the colorCorrection settings.

          The shading map is for the entire active pixel array, and is not
          affected by the crop region specified in the request. Each shading map
          entry is the value of the shading compensation map over a specific
          pixel on the sensor.  Specifically, with a (N x M) resolution shading
          map, and an active pixel array size (W x H), shading map entry
          (x,y) ϵ (0 ... N-1, 0 ... M-1) is the value of the shading map at
          pixel ( ((W-1)/(N-1)) * x, ((H-1)/(M-1)) * y) for the four color channels.
          The map is assumed to be bilinearly interpolated between the sample points.

          The channel order is [R, Geven, Godd, B], where Geven is the green
          channel for the even rows of a Bayer pattern, and Godd is the odd rows.
          The shading map is stored in a fully interleaved format.

          The shading map should have on the order of 30-40 rows and columns,
          and must be smaller than 64x64.

          As an example, given a very small map defined as:

              width,height = [ 4, 3 ]
              values =
              [ 1.3, 1.2, 1.15, 1.2,  1.2, 1.2, 1.15, 1.2,

                  1.2, 1.1, 1.0, 1.2,  1.3, 1.15, 1.2, 1.3 ]

          The low-resolution scaling map images for each channel are
          (displayed using nearest-neighbor interpolation):

          As a visualization only, inverting the full-color map to recover an

          The lens shading map calculation may depend on exposure and white balance statistics.
          When AE and AWB are in AUTO modes
          (android.control.aeMode `!=` OFF and android.control.awbMode `!=` OFF), the HAL
          may have all the information it need to generate most accurate lens shading map. When
          AE or AWB are in manual mode
          (android.control.aeMode `==` OFF or android.control.awbMode `==` OFF), the shading map
          may be adversely impacted by manual exposure or white balance parameters. To avoid
          generating unreliable shading map data, the HAL may choose to lock the shading map with
          the latest known good map generated when the AE and AWB are in AUTO modes.

          This may be different than the gains used for this frame,

          typically completes after the transform has already been
          applied to that frame.

          The 4 channel gains are defined in Bayer domain,
          see android.colorCorrection.gains for details.

          <details>
          Many light sources, such as most fluorescent lights, flicker at a rate
          that depends on the local utility power standards. This flicker must be
          accounted for by auto-exposure routines to avoid artifacts in captured images.
          The camera device uses this entry to tell the application what the scene
          illuminant frequency is.

          When manual exposure control is enabled
          (`android.control.aeMode == OFF` or `android.control.mode ==
          OFF`), the android.control.aeAntibandingMode doesn't perform
          antibanding, and the application can ensure it selects
          exposure times that do not cause banding issues by looking
          into this metadata field. See
          android.control.aeAntibandingMode for more details.

          Reports NONE if there doesn't appear to be flickering illumination.

          A hotpixel map contains the coordinates of pixels on the camera
          sensor that do report valid values (usually due to defects in
          the camera sensor). This includes pixels that are stuck at certain
          values, or have a response that does not accuractly encode the
          incoming light from the scene.

          To avoid performance issues, there should be significantly fewer hot
          pixels than actual pixels on the camera sensor.

          <details>
          When switching to an application-defined contrast curve by setting
          android.tonemap.mode to CONTRAST_CURVE, the curve is defined
          per-channel with a set of `(in, out)` points that specify the
          mapping from input high-bit-depth pixel value to the output
          low-bit-depth value.  Since the actual pixel ranges of both input
          and output may change depending on the camera pipeline, the values
          are specified by normalized floating-point numbers.

          More-complex color mapping operations such as 3D color look-up
          tables, selective chroma enhancement, or other non-linear color
          transforms will be disabled when android.tonemap.mode is
          CONTRAST_CURVE.

          When using either FAST or HIGH_QUALITY, the camera device will
          emit its own tonemap curve in android.tonemap.curve.
          These values are always available, and as close as possible to the
          actually used nonlinear/nonglobal transforms.

          If a request is sent with CONTRAST_CURVE with the camera device's
          provided curve in FAST or HIGH_QUALITY, the image's tonemap will be
          roughly the same.</details>

          <details>
          Camera devices will come in three flavors: LEGACY, LIMITED and FULL.

          A FULL device will support below capabilities:

          * 30fps operation at maximum resolution (== sensor resolution) is preferred, more than
            20fps is required, for at least uncompressed YUV
            output. (android.request.availableCapabilities contains BURST_CAPTURE)
          * Per frame control (android.sync.maxLatency `==` PER_FRAME_CONTROL)
          * Manual sensor control (android.request.availableCapabilities contains MANUAL_SENSOR)
          * Manual post-processing control (android.request.availableCapabilities contains
            MANUAL_POST_PROCESSING)
          * Arbitrary cropping region (android.scaler.croppingType `==` FREEFORM)
          * At least 3 processed (but not stalling) format output streams
            (android.request.maxNumOutputProc `&gt;=` 3)
          * The required stream configuration defined in android.scaler.availableStreamConfigurations
          * The required exposure time range defined in android.sensor.info.exposureTimeRange
          * The required maxFrameDuration defined in android.sensor.info.maxFrameDuration

          A LIMITED device may have some or none of the above characteristics.
          To find out more refer to android.request.availableCapabilities.

          Some features are not part of any particular hardware level or capability and must be
          queried separately. These include:

          * Calibrated timestamps (android.sensor.info.timestampSource `==` REALTIME)
          * Precision lens control (android.lens.info.focusDistanceCalibration `==` CALIBRATED)
          * Face detection (android.statistics.info.availableFaceDetectModes)
          * Optical or electrical image stabilization
            (android.lens.info.availableOpticalStabilization,
             android.control.availableVideoStabilizationModes)

          A LEGACY device does not support per-frame control, manual sensor control, manual
          post-processing, arbitrary cropping regions, and has relaxed performance constraints.

          Each higher level supports everything the lower level supports
          in this order: FULL `&gt;` LIMITED `&gt;` LEGACY.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          The camera 3 HAL device can implement one of two possible
          operational modes; limited and full. Full support is
          expected from new higher-end devices. Limited mode has
          hardware requirements roughly in line with those for a
          camera HAL device v1 implementation, and is expected from
          older or inexpensive devices. Full is a strict superset of
          limited, and they share the same essential operational flow.

          For full details refer to "S3. Operational Modes" in camera3.h

          Camera HAL3+ must not implement LEGACY mode. It is there
          for backwards compatibility in the `android.hardware.camera2`
          user-facing API only.

          <description> Whether black-level compensation is locked
          to its current values, or is free to vary.</description>
          <details>When set to `true` (ON), the values used for black-level
          compensation will not change until the lock is set to
          `false` (OFF).

          Since changes to certain capture parameters (such as
          exposure time) may require resetting of black level
          compensation, the camera device must report whether setting
          the black level lock was successful in the output result
          metadata.

          For example, if a sequence of requests is as follows:

          * Request 1: Exposure = 10ms, Black level lock = OFF
          * Request 2: Exposure = 10ms, Black level lock = ON
          * Request 3: Exposure = 10ms, Black level lock = ON
          * Request 4: Exposure = 20ms, Black level lock = ON
          * Request 5: Exposure = 20ms, Black level lock = ON
          * Request 6: Exposure = 20ms, Black level lock = ON

          And the exposure change in Request 4 requires the camera
          device to reset the black level offsets, then the output
          result metadata is expected to be:

          * Result 1: Exposure = 10ms, Black level lock = OFF
          * Result 2: Exposure = 10ms, Black level lock = ON
          * Result 3: Exposure = 10ms, Black level lock = ON
          * Result 4: Exposure = 20ms, Black level lock = OFF
          * Result 5: Exposure = 20ms, Black level lock = ON
          * Result 6: Exposure = 20ms, Black level lock = ON

          This indicates to the application that on frame 4, black
          levels were reset due to exposure value changes, and pixel
          values may not be consistent across captures.

          The camera device will maintain the lock to the extent
          possible, only overriding the lock to OFF when changes to
          other request parameters require a black level recalculation
          or reset.
          </details>
          <hal_details>
          If for some reason black level locking is no longer possible
          (for example, the analog gain has changed, which forces
          black level offsets to be recalculated), then the HAL must
          override this request (and it must report 'OFF' when this
          does happen) until the next capture for which locking is
          possible again.</hal_details>

          <details>
          When a request is submitted to the camera device, there is usually a
          delay of several frames before the controls get applied. A camera
          device may either choose to account for this delay by implementing a
          pipeline and carefully submit well-timed atomic control updates, or
          it may start streaming control changes that span over several frame
          boundaries.

          In the latter case, whenever a request's settings change relative to
          the previous submitted request, the full set of changes may take
          multiple frame durations to fully take effect. Some settings may
          take effect sooner (in less frame durations) than others.

          While a set of control changes are being propagated, this value
          will be CONVERGING.

          Once it is fully known that a set of control changes have been
          finished propagating, and the resulting updated control settings
          have been read back by the camera device, this value will be set
          to a non-negative frame number (corresponding to the request to
          which the results have synchronized to).

          Older camera device implementations may not have a way to detect
          when all camera controls have been applied, and will always set this
          value to UNKNOWN.

          FULL capability devices will always have this value set to the
          frame number of the request corresponding to this result.

          _Further details_:

          * Whenever a request differs from the last request, any future
          results not yet returned may have this value set to CONVERGING (this
          could include any in-progress captures not yet returned by the camera
          device, for more details see pipeline considerations below).
          * Submitting a series of multiple requests that differ from the
          previous request (e.g. r1, r2, r3 s.t. r1 != r2 != r3)
          moves the new synchronization frame to the last non-repeating
          request (using the smallest frame number from the contiguous list of
          repeating requests).
          * Submitting the same request repeatedly will not change this value
          to CONVERGING, if it was already a non-negative value.
          * When this value changes to non-negative, that means that all of the
          metadata controls from the request have been applied, all of the
          metadata controls from the camera device have been read to the
          updated values (into the result), and all of the graphics buffers
          corresponding to this result are also synchronized to the request.

          _Pipeline considerations_:

          Submitting a request with updated controls relative to the previously
          submitted requests may also invalidate the synchronization state
          of all the results corresponding to currently in-flight requests.

          In other words, results for this current request and up to
          android.request.pipelineMaxDepth prior requests may have their
          android.sync.frameNumber change to CONVERGING.

          <hal_details>
          Using UNKNOWN here is illegal unless android.sync.maxLatency
          is also UNKNOWN.

          FULL capability devices should simply set this value to the

          must occur before the camera device knows for a fact that the new
          submitted camera settings have been applied in outgoing frames.

          For example if the distance was 2,

              initial request = X (repeating)
              request1 = X
              request2 = Y
              request3 = Y
              request4 = Y

              where requestN has frameNumber N, and the first of the repeating
              initial request's has frameNumber F (and F &lt; 1).

              initial result = X' + { android.sync.frameNumber == F }
              result1 = X' + { android.sync.frameNumber == F }
              result2 = X' + { android.sync.frameNumber == CONVERGING }
              result3 = X' + { android.sync.frameNumber == CONVERGING }
              result4 = X' + { android.sync.frameNumber == 2 }

              where resultN has frameNumber N.

          Since `result4` has a `frameNumber == 4` and
          `android.sync.frameNumber == 2`, the distance is clearly
          `4 - 2 = 2`.

          <hal_details>
          Use `frame_count` from camera3_request_t instead of
          android.request.frameCount or `CaptureResult#getFrameNumber()`.

          LIMITED devices are strongly encouraged to use a non-negative
          value. If UNKNOWN is used here then app developers do not have a way
          to know when sensor settings have been applied.
